verse 1 :
breathe in breathe out whisper to me softly
youre alright its okay darling dont be sorry
slow down step back like you always tell me
it aint all bad its just overwhelming

i know you dont do to well with changes
seems like lately thats all weve been facing
i need patience for my imperfections
bear with me while i try to learn these lessons

prechorus : 
its a feeling i cant shake
and its not fair for you to shoulder all this weight
but for you id do the same
but for now

chorus
can you hold me up, cause aint strong enough right now
for the both of us and i dont wanna let you down
oh bleieve me love, were going to up off the ground
all i needs your love and time and well find a way somehow
can you hold me up, till we reach the other side
the road is rough but i think the ends in sight
oh believe me love, were gonna make it through the night
as long as ive got you and me and your loving hand in mine

verse 2:
you make me whole like i always wanted
wont let me go even at my lowest
id write your name in the stars if i could
take your place rearrange bear the weight like i should

prechorus 2:
its a feeling that i cant shake
its not fair for you to take all of my pain, 
but for you id do the same
but for now

chorus
can you hold me up, cause aint strong enough right now
for the both of us and i dont wanna let you down
oh bleieve me love, were gonna get up off the ground
all i needs your love and time and well find a way somehow
can you hold me up, till we reach the other side
the road is rough but i think the ends in sight
oh believe me love, were gonna make it through the night
as long as ive got you and me and your loving hand in mine

hook:
how long would i last before i collapse
im holding onto your love until we get past this
i hope its not too much
darling wont you hold me up

how long would i last before i collapse
im holding onto your love until we get past this
i hope its not too much
